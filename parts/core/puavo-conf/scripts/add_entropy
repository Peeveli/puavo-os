# Add (bad) entropy to kernel so that we can get through boot up until
# systemd takes over.  We are not doing much security critical here so this
# should be okay.  On the other hand the kernel entropy pool gets tainted
# with some bad random numbers for some time, which is not good, but hopefully
# other (better) sources will take over.  But without this boot does not get
# to systemd-stage on newer kernels, and on diskless clients we do not have
# much of a choice.  Note that the numbers here are completely deterministic
# and created with a linear congruential generator (LCG).
