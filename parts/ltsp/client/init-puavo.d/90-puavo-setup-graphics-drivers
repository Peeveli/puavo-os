# XXX OLD CODE, WHAT SHOULD BE CLEANED UP NOW?
# Clean up blacklists we do not want at this stage of boot
# (these block nouveau and radeon and these are required at an earlier
# stage for the fglrx and nvidia drivers to work).  However, we may want
# to use nouveau or radeon that are the default drivers for some chips.
# rm -f /etc/modprobe.d/fglrx.conf \
