my-show-desktop.png is just a copy of /usr/share/icons/Faenza/places/32/gnome-fs-desktop.png
my-show-desktop-hover.png is the same, but its brightness was increased by 32 units in GIMP.

The original icons that came with the extension were deleted. See extension.js for
information on how to obtain the original extension and the original icons.
