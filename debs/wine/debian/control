Description: Windows API implementation - standard suite
 Wine is a free MS-Windows API implementation.
 This is still a work in progress and many applications may still not work.
 .
 This package provides essential wrappers and convenience tools for the
 standard Wine components. It also employs the Debian alternatives system to
 provide the usual command names, e.g. "wine" instead of "wine-stable".

Description: Register Wine as the interpreter for Windows executables
 Wine is a free MS-Windows API implementation.
 This is still a work in progress and many applications may still not work.
 .
 This package registers Wine as an interpreter for Windows executables, using
 the kernel binfmt_misc module.  This causes Wine to be invoked automatically
 whenever a Windows PE (Portable Executable) file is to be launched.
 .
 WARNING:  This increases the risk of inadvertently launching Windows
 malware, so please make sure that you understand the security risks before
 blindly installing this package.
 .
 This feature is probably most interesting for automatic software testing.
 Desktop users usually don't need it, so don't install wine-binfmt unless you
 know that you need it.  Refer to Wine's README.debian for more information.
